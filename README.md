# ðŸŽ¯emma-suggestions

A GraphQL API that suggests new packages for you to download based on the dependencies you already have installed.

It is accesible at https://emma-suggestions.herokuapp.com/.
## Overview

It leverages Algolia's [npm-search](https://github.com/algolia/npm-search) and an Elasticsearch's [emma-replicator](https://github.com/JureSotosek/emma-replicator) copy of npm-registry.

The inner workings of the suggestions api and logic is described in this blog post.

It was primeraly made to be used with [emma-www](https://github.com/juresotosek/emma-www) and [emma-cli](https://github.com/Maticzav/emma-cli), a CLI tool that helps you with setting up your projects.
